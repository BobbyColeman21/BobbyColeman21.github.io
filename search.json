    "text": "During class this week, we learned how to create bar charts and discussed what makes a graph an effective tool to communicate data.\nTo do this, I made a bar chart showing UNL’s top 10 majors by students in 2024.\nFirst, I loaded the libraries I needed and started with a dataset of all UNL majors.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nmajors24 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/enrollment2024.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\nAfter loading the data and cleaning up the columns with clean_names(), I had to prepare the data for our chart. By filtering out any rows I didn’t need and sorting all specializations into their respective majors, I was left with the two rows I needed for the bar chart.\n\ntopmajors24 &lt;- majors24 |&gt; \n  filter(major_name != \"Total\") |&gt; \n  group_by(major_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_majors = sum(headcount)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=total_majors)\n\nI threw all the code into ggplot and made a decent graph.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = topmajors24, aes(x=reorder(major_name, total_majors), weight = total_majors)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the chart was weak. It doesn’t tell an interesting story or communicate an insight. A better graph would compare the top 10 majors by students between several years or show us the majors with the lowest student counts ."
