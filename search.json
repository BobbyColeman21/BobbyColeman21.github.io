    "text": "During class this week, we learned how to create bar charts and discussed what makes a graph an effective tool to communicate data.\nTo do this, I made a bar chart showing UNL’s top 10 majors by students in 2024.\nFirst, I loaded the libraries I needed and started with a dataset of all UNL majors.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nmajors24 &lt;- read_csv(\"https://mattwaite.github.io/datajournalismfiles/enrollment2024.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\nAfter loading the data and cleaning up the columns with clean_names(), I had to prepare the data for our chart. By filtering out any rows I didn’t need and sorting all specializations into their respective majors, I was left with the two rows I needed for the bar chart.\n\ntopmajors24 &lt;- majors24 |&gt; \n  filter(major_name != \"Total\") |&gt; \n  group_by(major_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_majors = sum(headcount)\n  ) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt; \n  top_n(10, wt=total_majors)\n\nI threw all the code into ggplot and made a decent graph.\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data = topmajors24, aes(x=reorder(major_name, total_majors), weight = total_majors)) +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, the chart was weak. It doesn’t tell an interesting story or communicate an insight. A better graph would compare the top 10 majors by students between several years or show us the majors with the lowest student counts ."

    "text": "In this assignment, we used Nebraska Department of Education data to practice joining. Like all projects, I started by loading the library and data.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\n\nscores &lt;- read.csv(\"NSCAS_ELA_Proficient_20232024.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\nThis dataset is pretty big and to join it, I need to filter it so I am only left with the columns that I wanted. After doing this, I created the new dataset readingdistricts.\n\nreadingdistricts &lt;- scores |&gt; \n  filter(subgroup_type == \"ALL STUDENTS\") |&gt; \n  filter(level == \"DI\") |&gt; \n  filter(grade == \"8\") |&gt; \n  filter(average_scale_score != \"*\") |&gt; \n  select(level, school_year, county, district, name, subject, grade, average_scale_score)\n\nI then loaded data about student discipline and used filter to get the same columns as I have in the above dataset.\n\ndiscipline &lt;- read.csv(\"StudentDiscipline_20232024.csv\") |&gt; clean_names()\n\n\ndistrictdiscipline &lt;- discipline |&gt; \n  filter(subgroup_description == \"All Students\") |&gt; \n  filter(level == \"DI\") |&gt; \n  filter(students_disciplined_count != \"*\") |&gt;\n   select(level, school_year, county, district, name, total_student_population_count, students_disciplined_count)\n\nBefore joining the two datasets districtdiscipline has 241 rows and readingdistrict has 367.\n\nreadingdistricts
